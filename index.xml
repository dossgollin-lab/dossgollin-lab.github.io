  <title>Bayesian Model Reveals Rising Extreme Rainfall on Gulf Coast</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2025/2025-02-05-preprint-bayesian-precip.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Our preprint, led by <a href="../../people/grad-students/yuchen-lu.html">Yuchen Lu</a> and titled “Bayesian Spatiotemporal Nonstationary Model Quantifies Robust Increases in Daily Extreme Rainfall Across the Western Gulf Coast”, is now live on ArXiV <span class="citation" data-cites="lu_spatiotemporal:2025">(Lu et al., 2025)</span>.</p>
<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We develop a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, the Spatially Varying Covariates Model, to address the challenges of estimating nonstationary extreme precipitation probabilities. Traditional models often assume stationarity, potentially underestimating risks due to climate change. Our model integrates nonstationarity and regionalization, leveraging spatial statistics and extreme value theory to provide robust estimates of extreme precipitation events. We validate our approach using daily rainfall data from the Western Gulf Coast, revealing significant increases in extreme precipitation intensity and variability, particularly around Houston and New Orleans.</p>
<p>Our model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional stationary models and nonstationary models that do not incorporate spatial pooling. Through rigorous cross-validation, we show that our estimates are well-calibrated and reliable, even at ungauged locations. The findings indicate a 10-35% increase in extreme rainfall over the past 80 years, with the largest changes in coastal areas. Compared to NOAA Atlas 14, our model suggests that current guidelines may underestimate future risks, highlighting the need for updated engineering designs to account for climate change impacts. This framework offers a practical and theoretically sound method for estimating nonstationary extreme precipitation probabilities, applicable to various regions and climate variables.</p>

  <title>NSF Grant to Study Flood Resilience in Rural Texas</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2025/2025-01-24-nsf-rural-flood.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We’re excited to announce that Rice University, in collaboration with The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&amp;M University’s Institute for Disaster Resilient Texas (IDRT), has been awarded a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation’s Confronting Hazards, Impacts and Risks for a Resilient Planet Program (CHIRRP). <a href="../../people/pi/james-doss-gollin.html">James Doss-Gollin</a> and <a href="https://gori.blogs.rice.edu/team/">Avantika Gori</a> (Rice) will join Keri Stephens (UT Austin), and Andrew Juan (TAMU) on a project to develop transformative approaches for improving flood resilience in rural Texas communities.</p>
<p>The project aims to create a performance-based framework that bridges critical gaps in flood hazard assessment and mitigation strategies for rural communities. Working in the rural communities of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/au1qoQeuwNLF7Pp68">Fort Hancock</a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XxeSF3fvVr41vHXE7">Premont</a>, Texas, we will develop new methods to characterize flood risks and co-design mitigation strategies that reflect local priorities. We’re particularly focused on identifying adaptations that address both frequent and extreme flood events, and that are scalable to communities with similar characteristics.</p>
<p>For more details, see the <a href="https://idrt.tamug.edu/idrt-team-builds-upon-drip-work-for-new-nsf-grant/">press release from IDRT</a> or <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2440167">the NSF award</a>).</p>

  <title>Pluvial Flood Emulation with Hydraulics-informed Message Passing accepted to ICML 2024</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2024/2024-06-09-kazadi-icml.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Our paper titled “Pluvial Flood Emulation with Hydraulics-informed Message Passing” has been accepted to the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) <span class="citation" data-cites="kazadi_icml:2024">(Kazadi et al., 2024)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a geographical region and precipitation data, our model predicts water depths in an auto-regressive fashion using a message-passing framework inspired by the conservation of momentum and mass as expressed in the shallow-water equations. This allows the model to effectively capture the propagation of water flow, particularly during the early stages of flooding when the water is scarce.</p>
<p>Our empirical results, based on a dataset covering 9 regions and 7 historical precipitation events, demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, providing accurate simulations even in complex topographies. This solution achieves accurate results using real ground elevation data. Additionally, our model excels in predicting flood dynamics for unseen storms and watersheds, showcasing its robustness and generalization capabilities.</p>
<p>For more details, see <a href="../../publications/conference/kazadi_icml_2024.html">here</a>. This is an exciting space, and we are looking forward to sharing more updates on our ongoing research in this critical area!</p>

  <title>How extreme was the recent San Jacinto River rainfall?</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2024/2024-05-14-san-jac-idf.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Earlier this month, persistent and intense rainfall to the northeast of Houston caused severe flooding on the San Jacinto River, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/southeastern-texas-sees-torrential-rain-causing-flooding-along-san-jacinto-river">affecting</a> thousands of residents. Our sincere best wishes are with everyone affected!</p>
<p>As we look to risk assessment, it’s important to determine how extreme this rainfall really was. <a href="../../people/grad-students/yuchen-lu.html">Yuchen Lu</a>, a third-year PhD student, compared the rainfall at different durations to Atlas 14 estimates of rainfall probability, finding that this was a 10 to 25-year event depending on how it’s analyzed. This underscores the importance of vulnerability reduction and flood preparedness.</p>
<p>You can find Yuchen’s more detailed analysis <a href="https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/SanJac2024_IDF/">here</a> or the source code <a href="https://github.com/dossgollin-lab/SanJac2024_IDF">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>As we look to managing future flood risks, further improvements to risk assessment are needed. Atlas 14 estimates are useful but do not account for the increasing likelihood of extreme weather. More fundamentally, probability distributions of annual maximum rainfall at a single point are completely silent on the spatial or temporal structure of rainfall, which can matter for flood impacts. We are working hard to address both of these limitations in our research – stay tuned for more updates!</p>

  <title>Paper on solar and wind potential during temperature extremes published in Environmental Research Letters</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2024/2024-03-18-singh-paper.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A new paper <span class="citation" data-cites="singh_potential:2024">(Singh et al., 2024)</span> in the journal <em>Environmental Research Letters</em> examines shows that increasing solar and wind energy capacity could help keep the lights on during widespread hot and cold spells across the U.S. The study found that solar and wind energy potential often increases during the types of large-scale heat waves and cold snaps that drive up energy demand and can cause power outages. While wind potential varied by region, solar potential was higher during both hot and cold extremes in nearly every part of the country. The findings suggest that expanding renewable energy could boost grid reliability while also reducing emissions.</p>

  <title>New preprint on transparency in peer-reviewed climate change research</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2023/2023-12-10-pollack-osf.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We’re pleased to see share a new preprint, “Peer-reviewed climate change research has a transparency problem. The scientific community needs to do better” <span class="citation" data-cites="pollack_transparency:2023">(<strong>pollack_transparency:2023?</strong>)</span>. This effort was led by Adam Pollack at Dartmourth and evolved out of many long discussions with colleagues in climate modeling, decision science, economics, engineering, environmental policy and social science, geosciences, hydrology, law, library science, philosophy, and statistics about the role of openness, transparency, and reproducibility in climate change research.</p>
<p>In this article, we articulate why transparency and openness matter in climate change research. We also sample papers in the “top” climate change journals and find that only five percent of our sample meets the minimal standard of fully open data and code required for reproducibility and replicability as defined by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. We conclude by recognizing the challenges involved and setting commitments to improve the transparency of our own research. We hope you will join us in these commitments and in broader discussions about the role of transparency in climate change research!</p>

  <title>Paper on trends in heating and cooling demand published in Communications Earth &amp; Environment</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2023/2023-11-01-amonkar-paper.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Our paper titled “Differential effects of climate change on average and peak demand for heating and cooling across the contiguous USA” was just published in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment <span class="citation" data-cites="amonkar_heatingcooling:2023">(Amonkar et al., 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>In this paper, we examine how climate change has impacted average and peak demands for heating (i.e., in the winter) and cooling (i.e., in the summer) in the United States in the observational record. This is an important problem because energy systems, including electricity systems with high shares of renewable energy, must be designed to meet peak demand. We find that while climate change has increased average and peak demand for cooling, but that peak demand for heating, which is an important driver of electricity demand in the winter, is dominated by year to year variability. System design and management must take rare winter peaks into account, especially as building heating electrifies.</p>
