<p>A new paper “Downscaling Extreme Precipitation with Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion,” published in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing <span class="citation" data-cites="liu_generative:2025">(Liu et al. 2025)</span>. This work is led by <a href="https://www.yuhaoliu.net/">Yuhao Liu</a>, a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and is the culmination of extensive brainstorming and research collaboration with coauthors <a href="https://www.ece.rice.edu/~ashok/">Ashok Veeraraghavan</a>, <a href="https://www.ece.rice.edu/~guha/">Guha Balakrishnan</a>, and Qiushi Dai as well as <a href="../../people/pi/james-doss-gollin.html">James Doss-Gollin</a>.</p>
<p>Many assessments of rainfall and flood hazard require high-resolution precipitation data (e.g., 1-4 km). While coarse global datasets from reanalysis products exist, and fine-grained radar data is available for recent years, there is a critical gap in producing long-term, high-resolution historical datasets needed for robust climate and hydrological modeling. Existing deep learning methods for this <em>downscaling</em> or <em>super-resolution</em> task often fail to accurately capture the statistical properties of the most extreme, and therefore most dangerous, events.</p>
<p>We developed Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (<code>WassDiff</code>), a novel generative AI framework. Unlike other diffusion models that can replicate the general distribution of rainfall, <code>WassDiff</code> is specifically designed to get the tails of the distribution right. It integrates a Wasserstein distribution-matching regularizer directly into the denoising process. This forces the model to pay close attention to the frequency and magnitude of extreme values, reducing the biases commonly seen in generative models for climate data.</p>
<p>Experiments show that <code>WassDiff</code> generates high-resolution precipitation fields that are more physically realistic and statistically accurate than those from competing models. It more faithfully reproduces the spatial patterns and, most importantly, the statistical characteristics of extreme rainfall, making it a more reliable tool for climate impact studies.</p>
<p>This work provides a significant step forward for both the machine learning and climate science communities. By creating more reliable high-resolution precipitation data, <code>WassDiff</code> can help scientists and engineers better assess flood risk, design more resilient infrastructure, and ultimately improve our understanding of how climate change impacts local communities.</p>

  <title>Bayesian Spatiotemporal Model Published in Environmental Research: Climate</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2025/2025-08-26-lu-spatiotemporal.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Congratulations to <a href="../../people/grad-students/yuchen-lu.html">Yuchen Lu</a> on her first first-author paper, “Bayesian spatiotemporal nonstationary model quantifies robust increases in daily extreme rainfall across the Western Gulf Coast,” which has been published open-access in Environmental Research: Climate <span class="citation" data-cites="lu_spatiotemporal:2025">(Lu, Seiyon Lee, and Doss-Gollin 2025)</span>!</p>
<p>This research represents the first step in Yuchen’s work, funded by Rice and the Texas Water Development Board, on incorporating robust estimates of nonstationarity into precipitation frequency estimates. She is currently working with colleagues at TAMU and TWDB to incorporate these insights and methods into Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves for Texas, and we will be presenting updates at the upcoming AGU Fall meeting.</p>
<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We develop the Spatially Varying Covariates Model, a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework that integrates nonstationarity and regionalization to address the challenges of estimating extreme precipitation probabilities. Traditional models like NOAA Atlas 14 assume stationarity, potentially underestimating current and future risks due to climate change. Our model leverages spatial statistics, extreme value theory, and Bayesian inference to provide robust estimates that pool information across nearby locations while allowing for temporal trends.</p>

<figcaption>Out-of-sample validation results showing the model’s ability to predict at ungauged locations</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Applying this framework to daily rainfall data from the Western Gulf Coast, we identify robustly increasing trends in extreme precipitation intensity and variability throughout the study area, with notable spatial heterogeneity. The findings indicate a 10-35% increase in extreme rainfall over the past 80 years, with the largest changes around Houston and New Orleans. Through rigorous cross-validation, we demonstrate that our estimates are well-calibrated and reliable, even at ungauged locations.</p>
<p>Compared to NOAA Atlas 14, our model suggests that current guidelines may underestimate future risks in many locations, highlighting the need for updated engineering designs that account for climate change impacts. Future projections for 2050 indicate that return levels will exceed current guidelines at most locations across the region.</p>
<p>Shout out also to coauthor Ben Seiyon Lee for patiently sharing his insights and expertise, and to colleagues at Rice, AGU, STAHY 2023, and ER: Climate for helpful suggestions and discussion.</p>

  <title>Updated Thoughts on the Guadalupe Flood</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2025/2025-07-08-guadalupe-flood.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>I’ve had a chance to read, listen, and speak with journalists and colleagues over the past day. Here are a few points that I think are important to communicate to journalists and the public, and that I wish I’d been able to communicate more clearly.</p>
<p>This was, first and foremost, a <strong>horrific tragedy</strong>. The pain of families who can’t locate their loved ones is unfathomable. The current focus is correctly on finding anyone who may still be alive, on supporting grieving families and communities, and on providing aid to those who have lost everything. However, this event <strong>also highlights systemic failures</strong> that must be addressed to prevent future tragedies.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Building in the floodway is dangerous.</strong> The floodway is the area where water flows fastest and deepest during a flood. It <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ucifloodlab_its-absolutely-tragic-that-so-many-young-activity-7347421268201132033-4fTV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAr66-cBAxyypBAXNFrv8xul5KsrgSYTorA">appears</a> that Camp Mystic was built in the floodway of the Guadalupe River, which is a profoundly dangerous place to build a camp for children. In most communities, likely including Kerr County (I have not verified local regulations beyond scattered reporting), new construction or major renovations would trigger some scrutiny of flood risk, but building codes are not often applied retroactively to existing structures. While it is <em>socially and financially costly</em> to abandon or existing structures, <strong>safety must come first</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Need for flood alert and response systems.</strong> The SSPEED Center, of which I am a member, has built real-time flood forecasts for Houston, and we (along with other groups) have the capability to build a similar system for the Guadalupe River, given time, resources, and collaborators. As my colleague Phil Bedient has eloquently <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/texas-flash-flood-prevent-gauge-warnings-20759811.php">argued</a>, we need to build a real-time flood forecasting system for the Guadalupe River.</p>
<ul>
<li>A critical component of this is enhancing <strong>real-time data collection</strong>, namely stream and rainfall gauges, to monitor floods in real time. The Upper Guadalupe River has five stream gauges along its roughly 230 mile length, and some of the gauges were not functioning during the flood. Better data collection is essential to understanding and responding to floods.</li>
<li><strong>The weather forecasts and warnings were generally good.</strong> The National Weather Service issued appropriate warnings as sources below describe in detail. However, predicting the <strong>exact magnitude and location</strong> of extreme rainfall is inherently uncertain, especially in complex terrain like the Texas Hill Country. The National Weather Service correctly identified the risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding, and issued appropriate and timely warnings, with certainty and accuracy increasing as the event approached.</li>
<li>Alerts without <strong>trust and plans</strong> do not save lives. People need to get the alerts, understand what they mean, and know what steps to take. Building a flood prediction model is a necessary, but not sufficient, step to saving</li>
<li>There is a trade-off between <strong>certainty and lead time</strong>. Individuals and communities can take actions to prepare for flash floods, but these actions require time to implement. Unfortunately, the hydrology of the Guadalupe River means that the time from rain to flood can be very short. This means that if you wait until the rain has already fallen, or worse until the rivers are already rising, you can only take a very limited set of actions. On the other hand, if you take action based on forecasts, you have more time to prepare, but the forecasts are inherently uncertain and you will sometimes take action that turns out to be unnecessary.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>I am not an expert on disaster response, communication, or the many agencies involved in flood response in this region, so I am in no position to point fingers or assign blame. However, it is unacceptable that an advanced society can place so little value on human life that we allow events like this to occur. There must be <strong>constructive accountability</strong> to ensure that we avoid preventable tragedies like this in the future.</p>

  <title>Bayesian Model Reveals Rising Extreme Rainfall on Gulf Coast</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2025/2025-02-05-preprint-bayesian-precip.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Our preprint, led by <a href="../../people/grad-students/yuchen-lu.html">Yuchen Lu</a> and titled “Bayesian Spatiotemporal Nonstationary Model Quantifies Robust Increases in Daily Extreme Rainfall Across the Western Gulf Coast”, is now live on ArXiV <span class="citation" data-cites="lu_spatiotemporal:2025">(Lu, Seiyon Lee, and Doss-Gollin 2025)</span>.</p>
<section id="summary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We develop a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, the Spatially Varying Covariates Model, to address the challenges of estimating nonstationary extreme precipitation probabilities. Traditional models often assume stationarity, potentially underestimating risks due to climate change. Our model integrates nonstationarity and regionalization, leveraging spatial statistics and extreme value theory to provide robust estimates of extreme precipitation events. We validate our approach using daily rainfall data from the Western Gulf Coast, revealing significant increases in extreme precipitation intensity and variability, particularly around Houston and New Orleans.</p>
<p>Our model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional stationary models and nonstationary models that do not incorporate spatial pooling. Through rigorous cross-validation, we show that our estimates are well-calibrated and reliable, even at ungauged locations. The findings indicate a 10-35% increase in extreme rainfall over the past 80 years, with the largest changes in coastal areas. Compared to NOAA Atlas 14, our model suggests that current guidelines may underestimate future risks, highlighting the need for updated engineering designs to account for climate change impacts. This framework offers a practical and theoretically sound method for estimating nonstationary extreme precipitation probabilities, applicable to various regions and climate variables.</p>

  <title>NSF Grant to Study Flood Resilience in Rural Texas</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2025/2025-01-24-nsf-rural-flood.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>We’re excited to announce that Rice University, in collaboration with The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&amp;M University’s Institute for Disaster Resilient Texas (IDRT), has been awarded a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation’s Confronting Hazards, Impacts and Risks for a Resilient Planet Program (CHIRRP). <a href="../../people/pi/james-doss-gollin.html">James Doss-Gollin</a> and <a href="https://gori.blogs.rice.edu/team/">Avantika Gori</a> (Rice) will join Keri Stephens (UT Austin), and Andrew Juan (TAMU) on a project to develop transformative approaches for improving flood resilience in rural Texas communities.</p>
<p>The project aims to create a performance-based framework that bridges critical gaps in flood hazard assessment and mitigation strategies for rural communities. Working in the rural communities of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/au1qoQeuwNLF7Pp68">Fort Hancock</a> and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XxeSF3fvVr41vHXE7">Premont</a>, Texas, we will develop new methods to characterize flood risks and co-design mitigation strategies that reflect local priorities. We’re particularly focused on identifying adaptations that address both frequent and extreme flood events, and that are scalable to communities with similar characteristics.</p>
<p>For more details, see the <a href="https://idrt.tamug.edu/idrt-team-builds-upon-drip-work-for-new-nsf-grant/">press release from IDRT</a> or <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2440167">the NSF award</a>).</p>

  <title>Pluvial Flood Emulation with Hydraulics-informed Message Passing accepted to ICML 2024</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2024/2024-06-09-kazadi-icml.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Our paper titled “Pluvial Flood Emulation with Hydraulics-informed Message Passing” has been accepted to the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) <span class="citation" data-cites="kazadi_icml:2024">(Kazadi, Doss-Gollin, and Silva 2024)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a geographical region and precipitation data, our model predicts water depths in an auto-regressive fashion using a message-passing framework inspired by the conservation of momentum and mass as expressed in the shallow-water equations. This allows the model to effectively capture the propagation of water flow, particularly during the early stages of flooding when the water is scarce.</p>
<p>Our empirical results, based on a dataset covering 9 regions and 7 historical precipitation events, demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, providing accurate simulations even in complex topographies. This solution achieves accurate results using real ground elevation data. Additionally, our model excels in predicting flood dynamics for unseen storms and watersheds, showcasing its robustness and generalization capabilities.</p>
<p>For more details, see <a href="../../bibliography/publications/conference/kazadi_icml_2024.html">here</a>. This is an exciting space, and we are looking forward to sharing more updates on our ongoing research in this critical area!</p>

  <title>How extreme was the recent San Jacinto River rainfall?</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2024/2024-05-14-san-jac-idf.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Earlier this month, persistent and intense rainfall to the northeast of Houston caused severe flooding on the San Jacinto River, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/southeastern-texas-sees-torrential-rain-causing-flooding-along-san-jacinto-river">affecting</a> thousands of residents. Our sincere best wishes are with everyone affected!</p>
<p>As we look to risk assessment, it’s important to determine how extreme this rainfall really was. <a href="../../people/grad-students/yuchen-lu.html">Yuchen Lu</a>, a third-year PhD student, compared the rainfall at different durations to Atlas 14 estimates of rainfall probability, finding that this was a 10 to 25-year event depending on how it’s analyzed. This underscores the importance of vulnerability reduction and flood preparedness.</p>
<p>You can find Yuchen’s more detailed analysis <a href="https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/SanJac2024_IDF/">here</a> or the source code <a href="https://github.com/dossgollin-lab/SanJac2024_IDF">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>As we look to managing future flood risks, further improvements to risk assessment are needed. Atlas 14 estimates are useful but do not account for the increasing likelihood of extreme weather. More fundamentally, probability distributions of annual maximum rainfall at a single point are completely silent on the spatial or temporal structure of rainfall, which can matter for flood impacts. We are working hard to address both of these limitations in our research – stay tuned for more updates!</p>

  <title>Paper on solar and wind potential during temperature extremes published in Environmental Research Letters</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2024/2024-03-18-singh-paper.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>A new paper <span class="citation" data-cites="singh_potential:2024">(Singh et al. 2024)</span> in the journal <em>Environmental Research Letters</em> examines shows that increasing solar and wind energy capacity could help keep the lights on during widespread hot and cold spells across the U.S. The study found that solar and wind energy potential often increases during the types of large-scale heat waves and cold snaps that drive up energy demand and can cause power outages. While wind potential varied by region, solar potential was higher during both hot and cold extremes in nearly every part of the country. The findings suggest that expanding renewable energy could boost grid reliability while also reducing emissions.</p>
