    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nClimate variability and change pose threats to lives and livelihoods. These climate risks can be managed through the design and operation of infrastructure systems, as well as through disaster response and recovery. Decisions about how to develop and choose risk management strategies are often based on pure vibes, but occasionally rigorous quantitative analyses that make use of scientific information can inform them (we will focus on these cases). These analyses involve integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines to balance competing goals (objectives) under uncertainty.\nIn this course, you will learn a structured “bottom-up” decision analytic framework for quantitative climate risk analysis. This involves (i) defining a system of interest and what constitutes desirable outcomes; (ii) understanding and modeling the specific pathways through which climate variability and change can create risk to this system; (iii) identifying possible “levers” for risk management; (iv) quantifying the performance of proposed decisions under climate and other interacting factors; and (v) generating possible alternatives. You will be assigned readings for every class that cover both methods and applications, and will work collaboratively to implement key concepts through programming problem sets. Active class participation is required.\nMethods covered include scenario analysis, exploratory modeling, cost-benefit analysis, single- and multi-objective policy search, stochastic control, deep uncertainty, robust decision making, and equitable decision making."

A central theme is quantifying uncertainty in extreme event probabilities, given the challenges posed by sparse observations and model biases. Through hands-on programming assignments, students will gain experience applying these methods to real-world problems. Topics include extreme value theory, optimal sampling, synthetic weather generation, downscaling and bias correction, surrogate models, and data assimilation. Recommended Prerequisite(s): A background in Bayesian statistics (e.g., 525) and/or machine learning (e.g., ELEC 478/578) is strongly recommended, along with familiarity with programming (e.g., Python, Julia, or R)."

    "section": "FAQs",
    "text": "FAQs\nAre positions fully funded?\nIn short: yes. All Ph.D. positions within the group will be fully funded. That includes tuition support, a stipend, and other benefits – see Rice’s 2022 Announcement. You will get more details in your formal offer letter if accepted.\nShould I write a research proposal?\nYou should include some research goals and ideas in your statement of purpose, but don’t write a separate research proposal. See the advice listed above for more details.\nHow is it the best way to find a master/Phd opportunity?\nWhen you’re applying to an undergraduate program, you care the most about the university. When applying to a PhD (in engineering at least), you care the most about the research group you will be working with.\nStart by thinking about what kind of research you want to do. Do you like lab work or computational work? What problems do you want to solve? What classes do you want to take? Sketch out some research ideas that interest you. Then, conduct a literature review and find out who is working in this space. Look at their web pages and papers and look for research groups that appeal to you.\nHow often do students usually travel for conferences?\nAfter the first year (primarily classes) I aim to fund students to go to the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting (1 week in December) or the American Society of Civil Engineers Environment / Water Resources Institute annual meeting (1 week in May). There are also lots of smaller and more targeted workshops that are often great experiences – they often have some student travel grants and with planning we can often fund student travel.\nWhat are things you wish more students knew before joining your program?\nI got some feedback from current students for this.\n\nBalancing course requirements (roughly 6 courses – see student handbook for details) and research can be a challenge, especially for first-year graduate students who generally have the heaviest courseloads.\nFor anyone doing modeling or data-driven work, most of your day will be spent (i) reading, (ii) writing, or (iii) coding. You should strive to improve your effectiveness in all three areas and plan to spend much of your day at a computer (which also means being deliberate about getting out of your computer!)\nYou will get more out of grad school (this applies to any program!) if you have a clear idea of what you want to learn and what you want to get out of grad school.\n\nWhat is the worst quality of life pain point that your students go through?\nI got some feedback from current students for this.\n\nTrying to learn how to do research while also taking a heavy courseload can make for a tough first semester (this was also my experience).\n\nHow has the lab planned and handled for student’s growth throughout their graduate program?\nI got some feedback from current students for this. We’re still figuring this out and will continue to adapt as we learn more. Students learn best from each other, so we have regular reading groups, where we meet (often with friends from other groups) to discuss papers. We help each other prepare for conferences, give each other feedback on papers, etc. This only works in an environment where we trust each other (both giving and getting feedback require trust) so we need to hold ourselves and each other to a high standard of integrity (i.e., be trustworthy!) As a young / small group, it’s also important to have interaction with people outside the group – we have meetings and social events with other lab groups, and most students are working on collaborative projects that include people from beyond our group.\nHow are publication credits discussed in the lab?\nJournals typically have clear expectations about what constitutes authorship and we follow those guidelines. The most important rule is to have clear conversations about authorship early on (this is the PI’s responsibility but students are always welcome to ask about authorship!)\nHow has the lab dealt with academic and social misconduct situations (plagiarism, bullying, harassment, misogyny, racism, transphobia, etc)?\nSo far we’ve been fortunate to have avoided significant academic and social misconduct. We obviously follow Rice University policies. We’ve also developed a policy on harassment and other expectations that will guide us if (when) these come up. In general we set high expectations for ourselves and for one another because a collaborative and open environment, which benefits everyone, requires mutual trust and respect."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Purpose of Review Electricity systems face substantial climate risks which are escalating due to electrification, renewable energy intermittency, population changes, and the intensifying impacts of climate change such as extreme temperatures and weather-induced infrastructure damage. This critical review investigates climate risks to the electricity sector and scrutinizes the methodologies used to represent climate risk in long-term electricity system planning studies. Recent Findings Climate risks to electricity systems are driven by extreme weather, average weather, technology, and other social and technological factors. All are expected to evolve in the future. Future climate risks to electricity systems depend on interactions between each, and thus assessing future climate risks to electricity systems requires exploring a wide range of possible futures. Summary Many studies rely on weather data and socio-economic scenarios that are inadequate to fully characterize climate risks to present and future electricity systems. We advocate for more holistic assessments that incorporate comprehensive weather data, acknowledge dynamic multi-sector interactions, and employ adaptive and robust methodologies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Pluvial flood risk is mostly excluded in urban flood risk assessment. However, the risk of pluvial flooding is a growing challenge with a projected increase of extreme rainstorms compounding with an ongoing global urbanization. Considered as a flood type with minimal impacts when rainfall rates exceed the capacity of urban drainage systems, the aftermath of rainfall-triggered flooding during Hurricane Harvey and other events show the urgent need to assess the risk of pluvial flooding. Due to the local extent and small scale variations, the quantification of pluvial flood risk requires risk assessments on high spatial resolutions. While flood hazard and exposure information is becoming increasingly accurate, the estimation of losses is still a poorly understood component of pluvial flood risk quantification. We use a new probabilistic multi-variable modeling approach to estimate pluvial flood losses of individual buildings, explicitly accounting for the associated uncertainties. Except for the water depth as the common most important predictor, we identified the drivers for having loss or not and for the degree of loss to be different. Applying this approach to estimate and validate building structure losses during Hurricane Harvey using a property level data set, we find that the reliability and dispersion of predictive loss distributions vary widely depending on the model and aggregation level of property level loss estimates. Our results show that the use of multi-variable zero-inflated beta models reduce the 90% prediction intervals for Hurricane Harvey building structure loss estimates on average by 78% (totalling US$ 3.8 billion) compared to commonly used models."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It is widely acknowledged that distributed water systems (DWSs), which integrate distributed water supply and treatment with existing centralized infrastructure, can mitigate challenges to water security from extreme events, climate change, and aged infrastructure. However, it is unclear which are beneficial DWS configurations, i.e., where and at what scale to implement distributed water supply. We develop a mesoscale representation model that approximates DWSs with reduced backbone networks to enable efficient system emulation while preserving key physical realism. Moreover, system emulation allows us to build a multiobjective optimization model for computational policy search that addresses energy utilization and economic impacts. We demonstrate our models on a hypothetical DWS with distributed direct potable reuse (DPR) based on the City of Houston’s water and wastewater infrastructure. The backbone DWS with greater than link and node reductions achieves satisfactory approximation of global flows and water pressures, to enable configuration optimization analysis. Results from the optimization model reveal case-specific as well as general opportunities, constraints, and their interactions for DPR allocation. Implementing DPR can be beneficial in areas with high energy intensities of water distribution, considerable local water demands, and commensurate wastewater reuse capacities. The mesoscale modeling approach and the multiobjective optimization model developed in this study can serve as practical decision-support tools for stakeholders to search for alternative DWS options in urban settings."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Projections of nonstationary climate risks can vary considerably from one source to another, posing considerable communication and decision-analytical challenges. One such challenge is how to present trade-offs under deep uncertainty in a salient and interpretable manner. Some common approaches include analyzing a small subset of projections or treating all considered projections as equally likely. These approaches can underestimate risks, hide deep uncertainties, and are mostly silent on which assumptions drive decision-relevant outcomes. Here we introduce and demonstrate a transparent Bayesian framework for synthesizing deep uncertainties to inform climate risk management. The first step of this workflow is to generate an ensemble of simulations representing possible futures and analyze them through standard exploratory modeling techniques. Next, a small set of probability distributions representing subjective beliefs about the likelihood of possible futures is used to weight the scenarios. Finally, these weights are used to compute and characterize trade-offs, conduct robustness checks, and reveal implicit assumptions. We demonstrate the framework through a didactic case study analyzing how high to elevate a house to manage coastal flood risks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "While most electricity systems are designed to handle peak demand during summer months, long-term energy pathways consistent with deep decarbonization generally electrify building heating, thus increasing electricity demand during winter. A key question is how climate variability and change will affect peak heating and cooling demand in an electrified future. We conduct a spatially explicit analysis of trends in temperature-based proxies of electricity demand over the past 70,years. Average annual demand for heating (cooling) decreases (increases) over most of the contiguous US. However, while climate change drives robust increases in peak cooling demand, trends in peak heating demand are generally smaller and less robust. Because the distribution of temperature exhibits a long left tail, severe cold snaps dominate the extremes of thermal demand. As building heating electrifies, system operators must account for these events to ensure reliability."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Centralized water infrastructure has, over the last century, brought safe and reliable drinking water to much of the world. But climate change, combined with aging and underfunded infrastructure, is increasingly testing the limits of—and reversing gains made by—this approach. To address these growing strains and gaps, we must assess and advance alternatives to centralized water provision and sanitation. The water literature is rife with examples of systems that are neither centralized nor networked, yet meet water needs of local communities in important ways, including: informal and hybrid water systems, decentralized water provision, community-based water management, small drinking water systems, point-of-use treatment, small-scale water vendors, and packaged water. Our work builds on these literatures by proposing a convergence approach that can integrate and explore the benefits and challenges of modular, adaptive, and decentralized (“MAD”) water provision and sanitation, often foregrounding important advances in engineering technology. We further provide frameworks to evaluate justice, economic feasibility, governance, human health, and environmental sustainability as key parameters of MAD water system performance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Mississippi River is a vital economic corridor used for generating hydroelectric power, transporting agricultural products, and municipal and industrial water use. Communities, industries, and infrastructure along the Mississippi River face an uncertain future as it grows more susceptible to climate extremes. A key challenge is determining whether Mississippi river discharge will increase or decrease during the 21st century. Because the 20th century record is limited in time, paleoclimate data and model simulations provide enhanced understanding of the basin’s hydroclimate response to external forcing. Here, we investigate how anthropogenic forcing in the 20th century shifts the statistics of river discharge compared to a Last Millennium (LM) baseline using simulations from the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble. We present evidence that the 20th century exhibits wetter conditions (i.e., increased river discharge) over the basin compared to the pre-industrial, and that land use/land cover changes have a significant control on the hydroclimatic response. Conversely, while precipitation is projected to increase in the 21st century, the basin is generally drier (i.e., decreased river discharge) compared to the 20th century. Overall, we find that changes in greenhouse gases contribute to a lower risk of extreme discharge and flooding in the basin during the 20th century, while land use changes contribute to increased risk of flooding. The additional climate information afforded by the LM simulations offers an improved understanding of what drove extreme flooding events in the past, which can help inform the development of future regional flood mitigation strategies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Winter storm Uri brought severe cold to the southern United States in February 2021, causing a cascading failure of interdependent systems in Texas where infrastructure was not adequately prepared for such cold. In particular, the failure of interconnected energy systems restricted electricity supply just as demand for heating spiked, leaving millions of Texans without heat or electricity, many for several days. This motivates the question: did historical storms suggest that such temperatures were known to occur, and if so with what frequency? We compute a temperature-based proxy for heating demand and use this metric to answer the question “what would the aggregate demand for heating have been had historic cold snaps occurred with today’s population?”. We find that local temperatures and the inferred demand for heating per capita across the region served by the Texas Interconnection were more severe during a storm in December 1989 than during February 2021, and that cold snaps in 1951 and 1983 were nearly as severe. Given anticipated population growth, future storms may lead to even greater infrastructure failures if adaptive investments are not made. Further, electricity system managers should prepare for trends in electrification of heating to drive peak annual loads on the Texas Interconnection during severe winter storms."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hydrodynamic model outputs are used in urban flood risk modelling, flood alert systems, and Monte Carlo hazard assessment. This study tackles an under-explored challenge wherein regular updates to the spatial characteristics of the watershed – due to factors such as changing land use – alter the watershed’s response to rainfall forcing, thus rendering existing model outputs obsolete. Because state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive, frequently re-running simulations can be costly. Modularization addresses this problem by requiring re-computation only for a limited domain affected by the land use changes. This article introduces a novel approach by modularizing the 2D domain into independent sub-domains before (‘discrete’) and after (‘abstract’) the numerical computations. Using the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) 2D model of a large urban watershed in Houston as an illustrative and generalizable testbed, we show that both the discrete and abstract modularization closely approximates the results from re-running the entire model. The computational cost of modularization scales linearly with model size for memory requirements as storing the solution on the interior boundaries (discrete) or throughout the domain (abstract) are necessary. This trade-off of memory for computation may facilitate advances in surrogate modelling or Monte Carlo flood risk assessment."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Precipitation exceedance probabilities are widely used in engineering design, risk assessment, and floodplain management. While common approaches like National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14 assume that extreme precipitation characteristics are stationary over time, this assumption may underestimate current and future hazards due to anthropogenic climate change. However, the incorporation of nonstationarity in statistical modeling of extreme precipitation has faced practical challenges, which have restricted its applications. In particular, random sampling variability challenges the reliable estimation of trends and parameters, especially when observational records are limited. To address this methodological gap, we propose the Spatially Varying Covariates Model, a hierarchical Bayesian spatial framework that integrates nonstationarity and regionalization for robust frequency analysis of extreme precipitation. This model draws from extreme value theory, spatial statistics, and Bayesian statistics, and is validated through cross-validation and multiple performance metrics. Applying this framework to a case study of daily rainfall in the Western Gulf Coast, we identify robustly increasing trends in extreme precipitation intensity and variability throughout the study area, with notable spatial heterogeneity. This flexible model accommodates stations with varying observation records, yields smooth return level estimates, and can be straightforwardly adapted to the analysis of precipitation frequencies at different durations and for other regions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative to numerical methods for physics-based simulation due to its flexibility and efficiency. Flood modeling is a key case study for ML-based simulation due to its relevance as a tool for supporting preventive and emergency measures to mitigate flood risks. However, the complexity of the topography or domain (ground elevation) and the sparsity of the time-evolving precipitations (external forcing) can be challenging for most existing ML approaches for simulating flooding processes in space and time. Another critical challenge is incorporating physics domain knowledge (hydraulics) into these data-driven models. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a hydraulics-informed graph neural network for flood simulation. Given a (geographical) region and precipitation data, our model predicts water depths in an auto-regressive fashion. We propose a message-passing framework inspired by the conservation of momentum and mass expressed in the shallow-water equations, which describe the physical process of a flooding event. Empirical results on a dataset covering 9 regions and 7 historical precipitation events demonstrate that our model outperforms the best baseline, and can capture the propagation of water flow more effectively, especially at the very early stage of the flooding event when the amount of water in the domain is scarce. Differently from some of the most recent methods for ML-based simulation, which tend to work well only when the domain is a smooth surface (e.g., flat terrain), we show that our solution achieves accurate results for real ground elevation data."

    "title": "Sequential Adaptation Through Prediction Of Structured Climate Risk",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Infrastructure systems around the world face immediate crises and smoldering long-term challenges. Consequently, system owners and managers must balance the need to repair and replace the aging and deteriorating systems already in place against the need for transformative investments in deep decarbonization, climate adaptation, and transportation that will enable long-term competitiveness. Complicating these decisions are deep uncertainties, finite resources, and competing objectives. These challenges motivate the integration of “hard” investments in physical infrastructure with “soft” instruments like insurance, land use policy, and ecosystem restoration that can improve service, shrink costs, scale up or down as future needs require, and reduce vulnerability to population loss and economic contraction. A critical advantage of soft instruments is that they enable planners to adjust, expand, or reduce them at regular intervals, unlike hard instruments which are difficult to modify once in place. As a result, soft instruments can be precisely tailored to meet near-term needs and conditions, including projections of the quasi-oscillatory, regime-like climate processes that dominate seasonal to decadal hydro-climate variability, thereby reducing the need to guess the needs and hazards of the distant future. The objective of this dissertation is to demonstrate how potentially predictable modes of structured climate variability can inform the design of soft instruments and the formulation of adaptive infrastructure system plans. Using climate information for sequential adaptation requires developing credible projections of climate variables at relevant time scales. PartI considers the drivers of river floods in large river basins, which is used throughout this dissertation as an example of a high-impact hydroclimate extreme. First, chapter 2 opens by exploring the strengths and limitations of existing methodologies, and by developing a statistical-dynamical causal chain framework within which to consider flood risk on interannual to secular time scales. Next, chapter 3 describes the physical mechanisms responsible for heavy rainfall (90th percentile exceedance)and flooding in the Lower Paraguay River Basin (LPRB), focusing on a November-February(NDJF) 2015-16 flood event that displaced over 170 000 people. This chapter shows that: 1. persistent large-scale conditions over the South American continent during NDJF 2015-16 strengthened the South American Low-Level Jet (SALLJ), bringing warm air and moisture to South East South America (SESA), and steered the jet towards the LPRB, leading to repeated heavy rainfall events and large-scale flooding; 2. while the observed El Niño event contributed to a stronger SALLJ, the Madden-JulienOscillation (MJO) and Atlantic ocean steered the jet over the LPRB; and 3. while numerical sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) and seasonal models projected an elevated risk of flooding consistent with the observed El Niño event, they had limited skill at lead times greater than two weeks, suggesting that improved representation of MJO and Atlantic teleconnections could improve regional forecast skill. Finally, chapter 4 shows how mechanistic understanding of the physical causal chain that leads to a particular hazard of interest – in this case heavy rainfall over a large area in the Ohio River Basin (ORB) – can inform future risks. Taking the GFDL coupled model, version 3 (CM3) as a representative general circulation model (GCM), this chapter shows that 1. the GCM simulates too many regional extreme precipitation (REP) events but under-simulates the occurrence of back to back REP days; 2. REP days show consistent large-scale climate anomalies leading up to the event; 3. indices describing these large-scale anomalies are well simulated by the GCM; and 4. a statistical model describing this causal chain and exploiting simulated large-scale in-dices from the GCM can be used to inform the future occurrence of REP days. Even the best climate projections must confront epistemic uncertainties. Part II of this dissertation explores how intrinsically flawed projections should inform sequential adaptation.First, chapter5reviews approaches for planning under uncertainty, considering the role of classical decision theory, optimization, probability, and non probabilistic approaches. Next, chapter 6 considers how different physical mechanisms impart predictability at different timescales and the implications of secular, low-frequency cyclical, and high-frequency cyclical variability for selection between instruments with long and short planning periods. In particular, this chapter builds from three assertions regarding the nature of climate risk: 1. different climate risk mitigation instruments have different project lifespans; 2. climate risk varies on many scales; and 3. the processes which dominate this risk over the planning period depend on the planning period itself. Defining M as the nominal design life of a structural or financial instrument and N as the length of the observational record (a proxy for total informational uncertainty), chapter 7 presents a series of stylized computational experiments to probe the implications of these premises. Key findings are that: 1. quasi-periodic and secular climate signals, with different identifiability and predictability, control future uncertainty and risk; 2. adaptation strategies need to consider how uncertainties in risk projections influence the success of decision pathways; and 3. stylized experiments reveal how bias and variance of climate risk projections influencerisk mitigation over a finite planning period. Chapter 7 elaborates these findings through a didactic case study of levee heightening in the Netherlands. Integrating a conceptual model of low-frequency variability with credible projections of sea level rise, chapter 7 uses dynamic programming to co-optimize hard (levee increase) and soft (insurance) instruments. Key findings are that 1. large but distant and uncertain changes (e.g., sea level rise) do not necessarily motivate immediate investment in structural risk protection; 2. soft adaptation strategies are robust to different model structures and assumptions while hard instruments perform poorly under conditions for which they were not de-signed; and 3. increasing the hypothetical predictability of near-term climate extremes significantly lowers long-term adaptation costs. Finally, part III seeks to unpack the conceptual experiments of parts I and II to inform policy and future research. Chapter 8 describes how constructive narratives about climate change can discourage climate fatalism. Instead, chapter 8 emphasizes that while climate change is and will be a critical stressor of infrastructure systems, individuals, communities, and regions have agency and can mitigate its consequences. Finally, chapter9concludes by discussing the key findings of this dissertation and exploring how future work on decision under uncertainty, technology, and earth systems science can aid the design and management of effective infrastructure services."

This is an important problem because energy systems, including electricity systems with high shares of renewable energy, must be designed to meet peak demand. We find that while climate change has increased average and peak demand for cooling, but that peak demand for heating, which is an important driver of electricity demand in the winter, is dominated by year to year variability. System design and management must take rare winter peaks into account, especially as building heating electrifies.\nFor more, see the abstract.\n\n\n\nAmonkar, Yash, James Doss-Gollin, David J.

    "text": "Summary\nWe develop the Spatially Varying Covariates Model, a novel Bayesian hierarchical framework that integrates nonstationarity and regionalization to address the challenges of estimating extreme precipitation probabilities. Traditional models like NOAA Atlas 14 assume stationarity, potentially underestimating current and future risks due to climate change. Our model leverages spatial statistics, extreme value theory, and Bayesian inference to provide robust estimates that pool information across nearby locations while allowing for temporal trends.\n\n\n\nOut-of-sample validation results showing the model’s ability to predict at ungauged locations\n\n\nApplying this framework to daily rainfall data from the Western Gulf Coast, we identify robustly increasing trends in extreme precipitation intensity and variability throughout the study area, with notable spatial heterogeneity. The findings indicate a 10-35% increase in extreme rainfall over the past 80 years, with the largest changes around Houston and New Orleans. Through rigorous cross-validation, we demonstrate that our estimates are well-calibrated and reliable, even at ungauged locations.\nCompared to NOAA Atlas 14, our model suggests that current guidelines may underestimate future risks in many locations, highlighting the need for updated engineering designs that account for climate change impacts. Future projections for 2050 indicate that return levels will exceed current guidelines at most locations across the region.\nShout out also to coauthor Ben Seiyon Lee for patiently sharing his insights and expertise, and to colleagues at Rice, AGU, STAHY 2023, and ER: Climate for helpful suggestions and discussion.\nFor more details, see here."

This work is led by Yuhao Liu, a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and is the culmination of extensive brainstorming and research collaboration with coauthors Ashok Veeraraghavan, Guha Balakrishnan, and Qiushi Dai as well as James Doss-Gollin.\nMany assessments of rainfall and flood hazard require high-resolution precipitation data (e.g., 1-4 km). While coarse global datasets from reanalysis products exist, and fine-grained radar data is available for recent years, there is a critical gap in producing long-term, high-resolution historical datasets needed for robust climate and hydrological modeling. Existing deep learning methods for this downscaling or super-resolution task often fail to accurately capture the statistical properties of the most extreme, and therefore most dangerous, events.\nWe developed Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a novel generative AI framework. Unlike other diffusion models that can replicate the general distribution of rainfall, WassDiff is specifically designed to get the tails of the distribution right. It integrates a Wasserstein distribution-matching regularizer directly into the denoising process. This forces the model to pay close attention to the frequency and magnitude of extreme values, reducing the biases commonly seen in generative models for climate data.\nExperiments show that WassDiff generates high-resolution precipitation fields that are more physically realistic and statistically accurate than those from competing models. It more faithfully reproduces the spatial patterns and, most importantly, the statistical characteristics of extreme rainfall, making it a more reliable tool for climate impact studies.\nThis work provides a significant step forward for both the machine learning and climate science communities. By creating more reliable high-resolution precipitation data, WassDiff can help scientists and engineers better assess flood risk, design more resilient infrastructure, and ultimately improve our understanding of how climate change impacts local communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAccess\n\n\n\nWe are happy to share a copy upon request if you don’t have access to this journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLiu, Yuhao, James Doss-Gollin, Qiushi Dai, Ashok Veeraraghavan, and Guha Balakrishnan. 2025. “Downscaling Extreme Precipitation with Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion.” IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 1–1. https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2025.3611872."

The pain of families who can’t locate their loved ones is unfathomable. The current focus is correctly on finding anyone who may still be alive, on supporting grieving families and communities, and on providing aid to those who have lost everything. However, this event also highlights systemic failures that must be addressed to prevent future tragedies.\nI am not an expert on disaster response, communication, or the many agencies involved in flood response in this region, so I am in no position to point fingers or assign blame.

Our sincere best wishes are with everyone affected!\nAs we look to risk assessment, it’s important to determine how extreme this rainfall really was. Yuchen Lu, a third-year PhD student, compared the rainfall at different durations to Atlas 14 estimates of rainfall probability, finding that this was a 10 to 25-year event depending on how it’s analyzed. This underscores the importance of vulnerability reduction and flood preparedness.\nYou can find Yuchen’s more detailed analysis here or the source code on GitHub.\nAs we look to managing future flood risks, further improvements to risk assessment are needed. Atlas 14 estimates are useful but do not account for the increasing likelihood of extreme weather. More fundamentally, probability distributions of annual maximum rainfall at a single point are completely silent on the spatial or temporal structure of rainfall, which can matter for flood impacts. We are working hard to address both of these limitations in our research – stay tuned for more updates!"

    "section": "Specific Responsibilities",
    "text": "Specific Responsibilities\nWe all have different roles and responsibilities in the lab. Here are some guidelines based on your role.\n\nPI (James)\n\nEnvironment: Manage the lab’s social dynamic to create a welcoming, inclusive, and productive atmosphere that brings out the best in everyone and celebrates diverse perspectives.\nDefine Research Directions: Identify relevant and exciting research questions, leveraging field awareness, creativity, and insight.\nProvide Technical Leadership: Establish a software and hardware environment that maximizes productivity for all team members.\nScientific Mentoring: Guide junior members in developing into independent scientists through regular meetings, feedback, and strategic planning.\nManage Publication Process: Assist in identifying publishable results, selecting appropriate journals, and navigating the revision process.\nSecure Funding: Obtain grant funding to support the group’s research and ensure coverage of all research-related expenses.\nProvide Feedback: Offer guidance on all aspects of research, from hypothesis formation to data management and paper writing.\nOffer Support: Provide moral support, career advice, and recommendation letters to help members navigate the challenges of research and academic life.\nProject Management: Help structure projects with clear goals, milestones, and timelines, balancing guidance with fostering independence.\nConference Support: Help students attend at least one major conference per year (e.g., AGU, EWRI) after their first year, provided they have work ready to present.\n\nIn addition, faculty have departmental duties, teach courses, participate in professional organizations, peer-review journal articles and grant proposals, serve on student committees, and more.\n\n\nGraduate Students\n\nGrant Writing & Funding: Writing proposals is a critical skill for any high-level researcher. You are expected to apply for relevant external fellowships (e.g., NSF GRFP, NASA FINESST) annually until funded. We will support you in this, but you must identify deadlines and draft materials well in advance. Even if not funded, the process refines your scientific logic.\nProject Management: You are the project manager for your dissertation.\n\nAdopt a system to track tasks.\nArrive at every meeting with a written agenda: What have I done? What am I stuck on? What is the plan for next week?\nRespond to emails/Slack within 24 hours during the week, even if just to say “I’m working on it.”\n\nCultivate Independence: By your third year, you should know the literature and technical details of your specific niche better than James does.\n\nDedicate time every day to reading.\nDon’t just execute the current task; look for the next logical question or the flaw in our current approach.\n\nBe Consistent: Success in research comes from compounding effort. Consistent, daily progress on hard problems is more effective than sporadic all-nighters.\nAdmin is Your Responsibility: You – not James or the department admins – are responsible for tracking your degree requirements. Know the Rice CEVE handbook. Track your own credit hours, qualifying exam deadlines, and committee formation forms.\nCareer Planning: Reflect on your career goals and work with James to get necessary training and exposure.\nBalance Independence and Guidance: Learn to strike a balance between working independently and seeking help when needed. Don’t hesitate to ask for assistance, but always come prepared with your thoughts and potential solutions.\nProfessional Development: Take charge of your own professional development. Seek out opportunities for skill-building, networking, and career exploration beyond what’s directly offered in the lab.\nWrite Before You Are Ready: Scientific writing is not the final step; it is the process of thinking. Do not wait until you have “all the results” to write. Draft outlines, figure captions, and methods sections as you work.\nMentorship & Citizenship: Part of your training is learning to lead. As you become senior, you will be expected to mentor undergraduate students or junior peers. This reinforces your own knowledge and multiplies the lab’s impact.\nReproducible Workflows: Maintain clean, documented, version-controlled code from the start. Your future self and collaborators will thank you.\nHonest Signals: If you are stuck, overwhelmed, or failing to meet a goal, communicate this early. “I tried X and it failed” is data; silence is a black box. We can fix a failed experiment, but we cannot fix a problem we don’t know exists.\n\nRemember, your graduate education is ultimately your responsibility. While James is here to provide guidance and support, you are in charge of your own success and development as a researcher.\n\n\nUndergraduates\n\nLearn a lot\nKeep track of and fulfill all college requirements\nWork on average 10hrs per week (unless otherwise discussed)\nTrack time spent working honestly and accurately\nSubmit weekly written reports and/or slides to James\nAttend lab meetings when consistent with your schedule\nBe helpful, friendly, and open to new ideas\nAsk Fearlessly: Your primary goal is to learn. You are not expected to know everything. Please ask questions when you are confused; pretending to understand slows you down, while asking questions helps everyone clarify their thinking."

    "text": "Open Science in Practice\nOpen science is the idea that scientific research should be transparent and accessible to everyone, especially including the taxpaying public that funds a substantial portion of our research. Open science is about democratizing knowledge and accelerating scientific progress to address urgent challenges like climate change, flooding, and poverty. Some key concepts of open science are:\n\nReproducibility: obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, methods, code, and conditions of analysis.\nReplicability: obtaining consistent results across different studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each with its own data.\nAccessibility: making research findings, data, and methods available to all levels of society, both amateur and professional.\n\nWe implement these principles in the following ways:\n\nWe make our data, code, and computational environments publicly available, typically no later than the publication of our work.\nWe prioritize using fully open-source tools whenever possible. When proprietary software or data is necessary, we document its use clearly and provide alternatives where possible.\nWe publish in open-access journals where appropriate and make post-prints freely available when not. We also share preprints on open-access servers.\nWe summarize our findings in non-technical blog posts, translate papers as needed, and use social media to share key findings.\nWe use permissive open-source licenses for our code, respecting and complying with licensing terms.\nWe employ various tools to facilitate reproducible science, including Python, Julia, Git, GitHub, Snakemake, Zenodo, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCredit\n\n\n\nThe organization and framing of our lab values borrows heavily from lab guides written by Lab Carpentry, the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles group at UIUC, the Andersen Lab at Northwestern, the Computer-Oriented Geoscience Lab at University of Liverpool, the Ocean Transport Group at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the Aly lab at Columbia, the Srikrishnan Lab at Cornell, and the Keller Lab Group at Dartmouth."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A new paper (Singh et al. 2024) in the journal Environmental Research Letters examines shows that increasing solar and wind energy capacity could help keep the lights on during widespread hot and cold spells across the U.S. The study found that solar and wind energy potential often increases during the types of large-scale heat waves and cold snaps that drive up energy demand and can cause power outages. While wind potential varied by region, solar potential was higher during both hot and cold extremes in nearly every part of the country. The findings suggest that expanding renewable energy could boost grid reliability while also reducing emissions.\nFor more, see the paper or read this Twitter thread.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nSingh, Deepti, Yianna S.

    "text": "Our paper titled “Pluvial Flood Emulation with Hydraulics-informed Message Passing” has been accepted to the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) (Kazadi, Doss-Gollin, and Silva 2024).\nGiven a geographical region and precipitation data, our model predicts water depths in an auto-regressive fashion using a message-passing framework inspired by the conservation of momentum and mass as expressed in the shallow-water equations. This allows the model to effectively capture the propagation of water flow, particularly during the early stages of flooding when the water is scarce.\nOur empirical results, based on a dataset covering 9 regions and 7 historical precipitation events, demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, providing accurate simulations even in complex topographies. This solution achieves accurate results using real ground elevation data. Additionally, our model excels in predicting flood dynamics for unseen storms and watersheds, showcasing its robustness and generalization capabilities.\nFor more details, see here. This is an exciting space, and we are looking forward to sharing more updates on our ongoing research in this critical area!\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKazadi, Arnold, James Doss-Gollin, and Arlei Silva. 2024. “Pluvial Flood Emulation with Hydraulics-Informed Message Passing.” In Forty-First International Conference on Machine Learning. https://openreview.net/forum?id=kIHIA6Lr0B."

    "text": "The session is listed in Hydrology, Natural Hazards, Global Environmental Change, and Atmospheric Sciences. Here’s the description:\n\nDecision-making for climate adaptation relies on projections of hydroclimate variables at a range of interconnected spatial and temporal scales. Many simulation and optimization frameworks rely on such projections as an input to system models, and so analysts must balance a desire for large ensembles to explore risk and grounding in physical principles for credible out-of-sample simulation against computational cost and interpretability. We welcome submissions related to the development and validation of statistical-dynamical models of hydroclimate variables, as well as their applications to infrastructure design, operation, and hazard assessment. Submissions related to weather and streamflow generators, emulators of sea level and storm surge, weather downscaling methods, and optimal sampling of design events are particularly encouraged."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A project led by Alicia Cooperman (TAMU), James Doss-Gollin (Rice), Alex Mayer (UTEP), and Shane Walker (UTEP) has been funded through the NSF EAGER SAI program. Here’s the description:\n\nIn this project, an iterative, collaborative framework for monitoring point of use water treatment in under­served communities is tested. This framework blends local expertise on social dynamics and water issues with project expertise in governance, water treatment, and systems modeling. This framework is co-developed with communities where residents rely on a combination of trucked­ and bottled water. Aging pipes and treatment facilities, droughts exacerbated, and contamination of water supplies all challenge America’s drinking water infrastructure. Water typically is treated at central facilities and then piped to users, but recent technological advances could enable water treatment at the point of use (e.g., a house). In theory, this approach can make water systems more resilient to extremes, reduce the need for pipes and pumping, help water systems scale up or down as populations change, and filter contaminants that existing plants cannot treat cost-effectively. However, point of use water treatment also shifts the burden of maintaining water treatment infrastructure, monitoring water quality, and governing water systems onto end users, creating new vulnerabilities for water infrastructure systems. In this project, an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems is developed to address this challenge. This research contributes to answering important questions for 21st century water infrastructure, including: (1) Under what biophysical and social conditions are decentralized water systems effective and likely to succeed? (2) What is the appropriate scale for decentralized water systems in small communities? (3) What are the barriers to water access in the US rural context?\n\n\nIn this project an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems is developed. The stress test integrates potential challenges identified by community members and leaders in focus groups with water quality sampling and mathematical modeling of water systems. The project is carried out through a series of iterative activities: qualitative interviews, field water quality observations, water system design, first round of focus groups, water security assessment, quantitative surveys and conjoint experiment, revised water system design, and a second round of focus groups. This project concerning participatory design for water quality monitoring extends observational research on water systems and social dynamics by actively engaging the community in collaborative focus groups about the current water system and potential future water systems.\n\nFor further details, see the NSF’s website."

    "text": "Summary\nWe develop a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, the Spatially Varying Covariates Model, to address the challenges of estimating nonstationary extreme precipitation probabilities. Traditional models often assume stationarity, potentially underestimating risks due to climate change. Our model integrates nonstationarity and regionalization, leveraging spatial statistics and extreme value theory to provide robust estimates of extreme precipitation events. We validate our approach using daily rainfall data from the Western Gulf Coast, revealing significant increases in extreme precipitation intensity and variability, particularly around Houston and New Orleans.\nOur model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional stationary models and nonstationary models that do not incorporate spatial pooling. Through rigorous cross-validation, we show that our estimates are well-calibrated and reliable, even at ungauged locations. The findings indicate a 10-35% increase in extreme rainfall over the past 80 years, with the largest changes in coastal areas. Compared to NOAA Atlas 14, our model suggests that current guidelines may underestimate future risks, highlighting the need for updated engineering designs to account for climate change impacts. This framework offers a practical and theoretically sound method for estimating nonstationary extreme precipitation probabilities, applicable to various regions and climate variables."

A heterogeneidade climática do semiárido resulta em variados níveis de garantia de precipitação para enchimento das cisternas, levando em conta também outros fatores tais como a área de contribuição de telhados para captação da chuva, o coeficiente de escoamento superficial nos telhados e o descarte sanitário das primeiras chuvas. Este artigo apresenta um modelo de análise conjunta destes fatores para avaliar a sustentabilidade hídrica das cisternas no semiárido brasileiro.

    "text": "Research that is salient, credible, legitimate, and timely can support climate-risk management goals around the world. Materials that are open and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) help facilitate credibility and legitimacy, and allow for timely reuse of salient resources in new contexts. For example, the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) regulatory impact analyses rely on open and FAIR socioeconomic, climate, and damage models. This approach enhances usability because it enables a broad community of end-users to improve the methods’ fit-for-use in a variety of contexts. In contrast, the booming climate services industry often produces salient and timely materials that are widely used but typically rely on closed models that do not facilitate building credible and legitimate knowledge. This approach risks misguiding decisions with broad-reaching consequences, such as where households choose to live, which mortgages financers securitize, and potentially which policies are adopted by US financial regulators. Unfortunately, too many climate-risk studies are neither open nor FAIR. For example, we demonstrate that only four percent of the most-cited peer-reviewed climate-risk studies in recent years fully share their data and code, a widely stated minimum standard for openness in the scientific community. We highlight strategies that researchers can take to facilitate faster progress in climate science, advance equitable access to usable climate-risk information, and improve climate-risk management. For the benefits of these strategies to outweigh their costs, it is crucial that research institutions and funders lead the way with substantial investments in necessary resources and infrastructure."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Flood-risk assessments inform consequential public decisions. These assessments increasingly use large-scale building inventories that offer granular details but come with little quality assurance. The U.S. Army Corps’ National Structure Inventory (NSI) is a prominent example. The Corps explicitly recommends that users evaluate data quality and adjust attributes as necessary. However, many studies skip this step. This raises the questions: How accurate is the NSI and how do any errors influence risk assessments and decisions? Here we use a case study for the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania comparing NSI-based damage estimates against estimates with highquality, feature-rich local building data under an ensemble of flood scenarios. The nearly ubiquitous practice of adopting the NSI without refinements can systematically distort flood damage estimates with potentially drastic implications for resource allocation decisions. Using the NSI to rank census tracts by damage-a common metric for prioritizing federal disaster funding-generally misclassifies one-fifth of tracts regarding their priority status. Simple refinements, such as correcting building locations, can drastically reduce classification errors, leading to correct identification of all tracts with respect to priority status in all but one flood scenario. Our findings demonstrate how the use of unrefined nationwide building inventories can compromise risk assessments and mislead resource allocation. We provide actionable guidance for enhancing inventory reliability to improve risk estimation and decision analyses."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Mississippi River is a critical waterway in the United States, and hydrologic variability along its course represents a perennial consideration for trade, agriculture, industry, ecosystems, the economy, and communities. Simulations of past, historic, and projected river discharge have been widely used to assess the dynamics and causes of changes in the hydrology of the Mississippi River basin over long time scales and to put changes of climate in context. The Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) offers such simulations to complement observational records of river discharge by providing fully coupled output from a state-of-the-art earth system model that includes a river transport model. Here, we compare observations and reanalysis datasets of key hydrologic variables to CESM1 output within the Mississippi River basin to evaluate model performance and bias. We show that the seasonality of simulated river discharge in CESM1 is shifted 3 months late relative to observations. This offset is attributed to seasonal biases in precipitation and runoff in the region. We also evaluate performance of several Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 6 (CMIP6) models over the Mississippi River basin, and show that runoff in other models – notably the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) – more closely simulates the seasonal trends in the reanalysis data. Our results have implications for model selection when assessing hydroclimate variability on the Mississippi River basin, and show that the seasonal timing of runoff can vary widely between models. Our findings point to (1) a need for continued developments in the representation of land surface hydrology in earth system models for improvements in our ability to assess the causes and consequences of environmental change on terrestrial water resources and major river systems globally, and (2) a need for caution and understanding of biases when applying these tools to practical risk assessment."

    "text": "Functional data analysis, which models data as realizations of random functions over a continuum, has emerged as a useful tool for time series data. Often, the goal is to infer the dynamic connections (or time-varying conditional dependencies) among multiple functions or time series. For this task, a dynamic and Bayesian functional graphical model is introduced. The proposed modeling approach prioritizes the careful definition of an appropriate graph to identify both time-invariant and time-varying connectivity patterns. A novel block-structured sparsity prior is paired with a finite basis expansion, which together yield effective shrinkage and graph selection with efficient computations via a Gibbs sampling algorithm. Crucially, the model includes (one or more) graph changepoints, which are learned jointly with all model parameters and incorporate graph dynamics. Simulation studies demonstrate excellent graph selection capabilities, with significant improvements over competing methods. The proposed approach is applied to study of dynamic connectivity patterns of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and reveals meaningful edges."

    "text": "The assessment and implementation of structural or financial instruments for climate risk mitigation requires projections of future climate risk over the operational life of each proposed instrument. A point often neglected in the climate adaptation literature is that the physical sources of predictability differ between projects with long and short planning periods: while historical and paleo climate records emphasize modes of variability, anthropogenic climate change is expected to alter their occurrence at longer time scales. In this paper we present a set of stylized experiments to assess the uncertainties and biases involved in estimating future climate risk over a finite future period, given a limited observational record. These experiments consider both quasi-periodic and secular change for the underlying risk, as well as statistical models for estimating this risk from an N-year historical record. The uncertainty of IPCC-like future scenarios is considered through an equivalent sample size N. The relative importance of estimating the short- or long-term risk extremes depends on the investment life M. Shorter design lives are preferred for situations where inter-annual to decadal variability can be successfully identified and predicted, suggesting the importance of sequential investment strategies for adaptation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "eneral circulation models (GCMs) have been demonstrated to produce estimates of precipitation, including the frequency of extreme precipitation, with substantial bias and uncertainty relative to their representation of other fields. Thus, while theory predicts changes in the hydrologic cycle under anthropogenic warming, there is generally low confidence in future projections of extreme precipitation frequency for specific river basins. In this paper, we explore whether a GCM simulates large-scale atmospheric circulation indices that are associated with regional extreme precipitation (REP) days more accurately than it simulates REP days themselves, and thus whether conditional simulation of the precipitation events based on the circulation indices may improve the simulation of REP events. We show that a coupled Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GCM simulates too many springtime REP days in the Ohio River Basin in historical (1950–2005) simulations. The GCM, however, does credibly simulate the distributional and persistence properties of several indices (which represent the large-scale atmospheric pressure features, local atmospheric moisture content, and local vertical velocity) that are shown to modulate the likelihood of REP occurrence in the reanalysis/observational record. We show that simulation of REP events based on the GCM-based atmospheric indices greatly reduces the bias of GCM REP frequency relative to the observed record. The simulation is conducted via a Bayesian regression model by imposing the empirical relationship between observed REP occurrence and the reanalysis-based atmospheric indices. Application of this model to future (2006–2100) representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario suggests an increasing trend in springtime REP incidence in the study region. The proposed approach of simulating precipitation events of interest, particularly those poorly represented in GCMs, with a statistical model based on climate indices that are reasonably simulated by GCMs could be applied to subseasonal to seasonal forecasts as well as future projections."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Mississippi River Basin (MRB), the fourth-largest river basin in the world, is an important corridor for hydroelectric power generation, agricultural and industrial production, riverine transportation, and ecosystem goods and services. Historically, flooding of the Mississippi River has resulted in significant economic losses. In a future with an intensified global hydrological cycle, the altered discharge of the river may jeopardize communities and infrastructure situated in the floodplain. This study utilizes output from the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) large ensemble simulations spanning 1930 to 2100 to quantify changes in future MRB discharge under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP3–7.0). The simulations show that increasing precipitation trends exceed and dominate increased evapotranspiration (ET), driving an overall increase in total discharge in the Ohio and Lower Mississippi River basins. On a seasonal scale, reduced spring snowmelt is projected in the Ohio and Missouri River basins, leading to reduced spring runoff in those regions. However, decreased snowmelt and spring runoff is overshadowed by a larger increase in projected precipitation minus ET over the entire basin and leads to an increase in mean river discharge. This increase in discharge is linked to a relatively small increase in the magnitude of extreme floods (2~% and 3~% for 100-year and 1000-year floods, respectively) by the late 21st century relative to the late 20th century. Our analyses imply that under SSP3–7.0 forcing, the Mississippi River and Tributaries (MR&T) project design flood would not be exceeded at the 100-year return period. Our results harbor implications for water resources management including increased vulnerability of the Mississippi River given projected changes in climate."

    "text": "Several recent widespread temperature extremes across the United States (U.S.) have been associated with power outages, disrupting access to electricity at times that are critical for the health and well-being of communities. Building resilience to such extremes in our energy infrastructure needs a comprehensive understanding of their spatial and temporal characteristics. In this study, we systematically quantify the frequency, extent, duration, and intensity of widespread temperature extremes and their associated energy demand in the six North American Electric Reliability Corporation regions using ERA5 reanalysis data. We show that every region has experienced hot or cold extremes that affected nearly their entire extent and such events were associated with substantially higher energy demand, resulting in simultaneous stress across the entire electric gird. The western U.S. experienced significant increases in the frequency (123%), extent (32%), duration (55%) and intensity (29%) of hot extremes and Texas experienced significant increases in the frequency (132%) of hot extremes. The frequency of cold extremes has decreased across most regions without substantial changes in other characteristics. Using power outage data, we show that recent widespread extremes in nearly every region have coincided with power outages, and such outages account for between 12%–52% of all weather-related outages in the past decade depending on the region. Importantly, we find that solar potential is significantly higher during widespread hot extremes in all six regions and during widespread cold extremes in five of the six regions. Further, wind potential is significantly higher during widespread hot or cold extremes in at least three regions. Our findings indicate that increased solar and wind capacity could be leveraged to meet the higher demand for energy during such widespread extremes, improving the resilience and reliability of our energy systems in addition to limiting carbon emissions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Understanding the risks posed by extreme rainfall events requires analysis of precipitation fields with high resolution (to assess localized hazards) and extensive historical coverage (to capture sufficient examples of rare occurrences). Radar and mesonet networks provide precipitation fields at 1 km resolution but with limited historical and geographical coverage, while gauge-based records and reanalysis products cover decades of time on a global scale, but only at 30–50 km resolution. To help provide high-resolution precipitation estimates over long time scales, this study presents Wasserstein Regularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a diffusion framework to downscale (super-resolve) precipitation fields from low-resolution gauge and reanalysis products. Crucially, unlike related deep generative models, WassDiff integrates a Wasserstein distribution-matching regularizer to the denoising process to reduce empirical biases at extreme intensities. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that WassDiff quantitatively outperforms existing state-of-the-art generative downscaling methods at recovering extreme weather phenomena such as tropical storms and cold fronts. Case studies further qualitatively demonstrate WassDiff’s ability to reproduce realistic fine-scale structures and accurate peak intensities of these phenomena. By unlocking decades of high-resolution rainfall information from globally available coarse records, WassDiff offers a practical pathway toward more accurate flood-risk assessments and climate-adaptation planning."

This article presents an analytic model based on daily precipitation data to evaluate the sustainability of rainwater capture. Application of this model to analysis of the P1MC reveals the heterogeneous climate in this region causes large spatial variability in the effectiveness of this program. In addition, the size of the area of capture, the run-off coefficient of the roofs, and the amount of first-flush diversion also have important effects.

    "text": "The property damaged and the lives disrupted by recent hurricanes, floods, droughts, and water quality violations highlight the inadequacy of water infrastructure in the United States and around the world. Decisions about managing these infrastructure systems are strongly informed by societal perceptions of risk, which in turn are shaped through narratives of high-impact events in academic, governmental, commercial, and popular media. In recent years, post hoc analyses of high-impact water and climate disasters have increasingly focused on the role of anthropogenic climate change (ACC). This is a welcome development that helps to build support for much-needed mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions and pushes companies, governments, and aid agencies to prepare for a changing environment. Yet climate impacts require a confluence of physical hazards and societal vulnerabilities, and so narratives centered only on the role of ACC can neglect the aging infrastructure, increasing development with exposure to climate risks, and inadequate maintenance that set the stage for meteorological and hydrological events to become humanitarian disasters. The fatalistic narratives that emerge, which often imply that because an event was exacerbated by climate change its consequences could not have been averted, discourage adaptive planning."

    "title": "FloodGNN-GRU: A Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network For Flood Prediction",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Classical approaches for flood prediction apply numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations that capture the physics of inundation processes (e.g., the 2D Shallow Water equations). However, traditional inundation models are still unable to satisfy the requirements of many relevant applications, including early-warning systems, high-resolution (or large spatial domain) simulations, and robust inference over distributions of inputs (e.g., rainfall events). Machine learning (ML) approaches are a promising alternative to physics-based models due to their ability to efficiently capture correlations between relevant inputs and outputs in a data-driven fashion. In particular, once trained, ML models can be tested/deployed much more efficiently than classical approaches. Yet, few ML-based solutions for spatio-temporal flood prediction have been developed, and their reliability/accuracy is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose FloodGNN-GRU, a spatio-temporal flood prediction model that combines a graph neural network (GNN) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture. Compared to existing approaches, FloodGNN-GRU (i) employs a graph-based model (GNN); (ii) operates on both spatial and temporal dimensions; and (iii) processes the water flow velocities as vector features, instead of scalar features. We evaluate FloodGNN-GRU using a LISFLOOD-FP simulation of Hurricane Harvey (2017) in Houston, Texas. Our results, based on several metrics, show that FloodGNN-GRU outperforms several data-driven alternatives in terms of accuracy. Moreover, our approach can be trained 100x faster and tested 1000x faster than the time required to run a comparable simulation. These findings illustrate the potential of ML-based methods to efficiently emulate physics-based inundation models, especially for short-term predictions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The potential for extreme climate events to cluster in space and time has driven increased interest in understanding and predicting compound climate risks. Through a case study on floods in the Ohio River Basin, we demonstrated that low-frequency climate variability could drive spatial and temporal clustering of the risk of regional climate extremes. Long records of annual maximum streamflow from 24 USGS gauges were used to explore the regional spatiotemporal patterns of flooding and their associated large-scale climate modes. We found that the dominant time scales of flood risk in this basin were in the interannual (6–7 years), decadal (11–13 years), and secular bands and that different sub-regions within the Ohio River Basin responded differently to large-scale forcing. We showed that the leading modes of streamflow variability were associated with ENSO and secular trends. The low-frequency climate modes translated into epochs of increased and decreased flood risk with multiple extreme floods or the absence of extreme floods, thus informing the nature of compound climate-induced flood risk. A notable finding is that the secular trend was associated with an east-to-west shift in the flood incidence and the associated storm track. This is consistent with some expectations of climate change projections."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During the austral summer 2015/16, severe flooding displaced over 170 000 people on the Paraguay River system in Paraguay, Argentina, and southern Brazil. These floods were driven by repeated heavy rainfall events in the lower Paraguay River basin. Alternating sequences of enhanced moisture inflow from the South American low-level jet and local convergence associated with baroclinic systems were conducive to mesoscale convective activity and enhanced precipitation. These circulation patterns were favored by cross-time-scale interactions of a very strong El Niño event, an unusually persistent Madden–Julian oscillation in phases 4 and 5, and the presence of a dipole SST anomaly in the central southern Atlantic Ocean. The simultaneous use of seasonal and subseasonal heavy rainfall predictions could have provided decision-makers with useful information about the start of these flooding events from two to four weeks in advance. Probabilistic seasonal forecasts available at the beginning of November successfully indicated heightened probability of heavy rainfall (90th percentile) over southern Paraguay and Brazil for December–February. Raw subseasonal forecasts of heavy rainfall exhibited limited skill at lead times beyond the first two predicted weeks, but a model output statistics approach involving principal component regression substantially improved the spatial distribution of skill for week 3 relative to other methods tested, including extended logistic regressions. A continuous monitoring of climate drivers impacting rainfall in the region, and the use of statistically corrected heavy precipitation seasonal and subseasonal forecasts, may help improve flood preparedness in this and other regions."

We will have to fill out a syllabus contract at the beginning of the semester. Typically you would be in lab for at least 10 hours a week, and you would also be required to attend lab meetings, read a few papers, and complete a few short written assignments. You can enroll in undergraduate research multiple times, subject to the requirements of the University and your degree.\nTo Apply: send me an email from your Rice University account:\n\nPut “CEVE 499: Research for Credit” in the subject line of the email,\nAttach your CV or resume (short is fine, undergrads don’t need a 5 page CV!) as a .pdf file\nAttach a 1-2 page project proposal. The more detailed, the better (see below) as a .pdf file\nSuggest some times when you might be available to talk further in the body of the email.\n\n\n\nSenior Thesis Supervision\nIf you are interested in having me supervise your senior thesis project, I recommend doing research for credit course during your sophomore or junior year.\nTo Apply: as above (to do research for credit) but put “Senior Thesis Supervision” in the subject line of the email.\n\n\nResearch for Pay\nIf you want to work in lab and earn money, there are two different options. The lab can pay you as a research assistant, typically 5-10 hours per week at $12 per hour or as discussed. We have a limited number of hours available each semester, so these positions are competitive. Open positions may be posted on our Open Positions page, but if you have concrete ideas you can propose a project (see below).\nWe can apply for an undergraduate research fellowship to fund your time in lab. Because these fellowships are intended to support your academic development, undergraduate fellows will be required to participate in lab meetings. This option is also available during the summer.\nTo Apply: as above (to do research for credit) but put “Research for Pay” in the subject line of the email.\n\n\nVolunteer Research\nUnpaid internships give an unfair advantage to those who can afford to volunteer their time and contribute to unequal representation in the field. We do not take unpaid volunteers as research assistants in our lab, except for academic credit."

    "text": "Course Description\nSensors, satellites, people, robots, and drones collect a wealth of data describing environmental processes relevant for understanding and managing the natural and built environment. Making sense of these data sets, sometimes vast and sometimes consisting of a few observations, requires integrating domain knowledge, computational methods, and statistical models. In a nutshell, data science.\nThe path from data and theory to models, inference, and ultimately decisions is long, winding, and perilous. In this course, you will learn not only how to fit models, but also how to interpret, critique, improve, and evaluate models and model-based inference. Specifically, you will learn a principled workflow for using data to inform decisions that:\n\ncredibly describes the physical processes that generated the data;\nflexibly makes use of multiple sources of information;\ntransparently communicates imperfect modeling assumptions; and\nallows you to reason about uncertainty using the language of probability theory.\n\nApplications to water, climate, air, and geologic data will emphasize models for spatial and temporal data."

    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nClimate variability and change pose threats to lives and livelihoods. These climate risks can be managed through the design and operation of infrastructure systems, as well as through disaster response and recovery. Decisions about how to develop and choose risk management strategies are often based on pure vibes, but occasionally rigorous quantitative analyses that make use of scientific information can inform them (we will focus on these cases). These analyses involve integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines to balance competing goals (objectives) under uncertainty.\nIn this course, you will learn climate science, uncertainty quantification, and decision analysis methods to support climate risk management. You will be assigned readings for every class that cover both methods and applications, and will work collaboratively to implement key concepts through programming problem sets. Active class participation is required. Methods covered include scenario analysis, exploratory modeling, cost-benefit analysis, single- and multi-objective policy search, reinforcement learning, deep uncertainty, robust decision making, and equitable decision making."
