    <p>In this project, an iterative, collaborative framework for monitoring point of use water treatment in under­served communities is tested. This framework blends local expertise on social dynamics and water issues with project expertise in governance, water treatment, and systems modeling. This framework is co-developed with communities where residents rely on a combination of trucked­ and bottled water. Aging pipes and treatment facilities, droughts exacerbated, and contamination of water supplies all challenge America’s drinking water infrastructure. Water typically is treated at central facilities and then piped to users, but recent technological advances could enable water treatment at the point of use (e.g., a house). In theory, this approach can make water systems more resilient to extremes, reduce the need for pipes and pumping, help water systems scale up or down as populations change, and filter contaminants that existing plants cannot treat cost-effectively. However, point of use water treatment also shifts the burden of maintaining water treatment infrastructure, monitoring water quality, and governing water systems onto end users, creating new vulnerabilities for water infrastructure systems. In this project, an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems is developed to address this challenge. This research contributes to answering important questions for 21st century water infrastructure, including: (1) Under what biophysical and social conditions are decentralized water systems effective and likely to succeed? (2) What is the appropriate scale for decentralized water systems in small communities? (3) What are the barriers to water access in the US rural context?</p>

<p>In this project an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems is developed. The stress test integrates potential challenges identified by community members and leaders in focus groups with water quality sampling and mathematical modeling of water systems. The project is carried out through a series of iterative activities: qualitative interviews, field water quality observations, water system design, first round of focus groups, water security assessment, quantitative surveys and conjoint experiment, revised water system design, and a second round of focus groups. This project concerning participatory design for water quality monitoring extends observational research on water systems and social dynamics by actively engaging the community in collaborative focus groups about the current water system and potential future water systems.”</p>

    <p>The Mississippi River drains a continent, gathering water from as far as Pennsylvania and Montana and discharging it into the Gulf of Mexico.
The channeling of so much water into a single river naturally raises the stakes for flooding, and the river has one of the most extensive flood mitigation systems in the world.
But there are limits to the protection afforded by the current system and we do not know if it will prove adequate as climate warms. The effect of warming on flood risk is determined by a balance between competing effects: warming by itself would likely reduce discharge by increasing the amount of moisture that evaporates from the land rather than running off into streams.
Warming also reduces snowpack, leading to a reduction in the springtime streamflow resulting from snow melt. On the other hand warmer air generally holds more moisture, which leads to increases in both mean and extreme precipitation, thus increasing flood risk.</p>

<p>This projects seeks to determine the net effect of these competing influences on Mississippi River discharge, which serves as a broad-brush proxy for flood risk.
Much of the work involves assessments of Mississippi discharge in climate models, particularly the Community Earth System Model (CESM), which uses a River Transport Model (RTM) for the Mississippi. Preliminary results show river discharge increasing dramatically (by perhaps 130%) over the 21st century under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (RCP8.5) but remaining within historical norms under lower emissions (RCP4.5).
This contrast suggests that the balance between streamflow increases from precipitation and decreases from evaporation and snow melt could be temperature dependent, with precipitation winning out at higher levels of warming.</p>

<p>The project also considers the factors driving Mississippi discharge over the last millennium using a combination of weather and streamflow observing networks, paleoclimate reconstructions, and ensembles of present-day and last millennium climate model simulations.
Recent work by the Principal Investigators (PIs) suggests that the warm period of the Medieval Climate Anomaly featured lower discharge than the Little Ice Age, a result that is generally captured by CESM simulations of the last millennium.
The result is also in keeping with the moderate warming scenario for the 21st century.</p>

<p>The work is of societal interest due to the focus on flood risk, and the PIs are working with stakeholders including the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative to understand the practical significance of their results and provide decision support.
The project also involves education and outreach, supporting summer research experiences for high school students and working with the Girl Scouts of America to encourage girls and young women to consider careers in science.
The project provides support and training to a postdoctoral researcher and two graduate students.</p>

    <p>Fast-growing coastal megacities around the world rely on aging and often inadequate in-frastructure to manage rapidly evolving weather and climate risks.
For example, the increasingfrequency and severity of extreme rainfall has cost hundreds of billions of dollars to date andposes a significant threat to transportation, energy, housing, dam safety, and healthcare infrastructure as well as to globally connected industrial supply chains and the consumers who rely upon them.
Engineering codes specify performance requirements such as the minimum allowable con-veyance capacity for stormwater management.
In the United States, these codes rely on probability distributions of extreme rainfall developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-ministration (NOAA).</p>

<p>Yet although climate-driven changes in extreme precipitation are already evident in Texas and beyond, current NOAA Atlas 14 frequency analysis methods assume stationarity in both the historical data used in making the estimates and in the future conditions.
Thus, infrastructure built today is likely to be underprepared for future climate.
Additionally, these statistical methods do not have a clear answer for how an extreme rainfall event observed in one location should affect the estimated probability distribution of extreme rainfall in nearby locations.</p>

<p>In this research, we will leverage earth observations at multiple timescales (recent radar observations, station observations, and paleoclimate reconstructions) and novel space-time statistical approaches to model the probability distributions of extreme rainfall.
This work can inform how existing or alternative engineering codes will perform under actual and anticipated climates.</p>
