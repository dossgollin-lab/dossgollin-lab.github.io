Our review paper titled "Improving the representation of climate risks in long-term electricity systems planning: a critical review" has been published in the journal Current Sustainable/Renewable Energy Reports.

In this paper [@doss-gollin_review:2023], we review the literature on long-term electricity systems planning under climate change and identify key gaps in the representation of climate risks.
