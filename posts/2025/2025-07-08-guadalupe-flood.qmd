I've had a chance to read, listen, and speak with journalists and colleagues over the past day.
Here are a few points that I think are important to communicate to journalists and the public, and that I wish I'd been able to communicate more clearly.

This was, first and foremost, a **horrific tragedy**.
The pain of families who can't locate their loved ones is unfathomable.
The current focus is correctly on finding anyone who may still be alive, on supporting grieving families and communities, and on providing aid to those who have lost everything.
However, this event **also highlights systemic failures** that must be addressed to prevent future tragedies.

1. **Building in the floodway is dangerous.**
The floodway is the area where water flows fastest and deepest during a flood.
It [appears](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ucifloodlab_its-absolutely-tragic-that-so-many-young-activity-7347421268201132033-4fTV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAr66-cBAxyypBAXNFrv8xul5KsrgSYTorA) that Camp Mystic was built in the floodway of the Guadalupe River, which is a profoundly dangerous place to build a camp for children.
While it is **socially and financially costly** to abandon existing structures, safety should come first—putting vulnerable populations in known floodways is irresponsible.

2. **Weather forecasts and warnings were generally good.**
Quantitative rainfall forecasts are inherently uncertain, especially for extreme events in complex terrain.
The National Weather Service correctly identified the risk of heavy rainfall and flash flooding, and issued appropriate and timely warnings, with certainty and accuracy increasing as the event approached (see sources below).

3. **Certainty vs. lead time is a tradeoff.**
There is a range of protective actions that individuals and communities can take to prepare for flash floods, but these actions require time to implement.
Unfortunately, the hydrology of the Guadalupe River means that the time from rain to flood can be very short—on the order of two hours depending on location.
This means that if you wait until the rain has already fallen, or worse until the rivers are already rising, you can only take a very limited set of actions.
On the other hand, if you take action based on forecasts, you have more time to prepare, but the forecasts are inherently uncertain and you will sometimes take action that turns out to be unnecessary.
While improving weather forecasts is important (and cutting weather forecasting capacity is dangerous), this tradeoff isn't going away.

4. **Flood risk maps did their job.**
I have a LOT to say about the inadequacy of our existing flood-risk maps.
The concept of a "100 year flood" doesn't really make sense.
They don't capture the risks of a warmer world.
They ignore compound floods.
Yet, they are much better than nothing, especially in hilly terrain where it generally floods in the same places every time.
The places that flooded in this event were generally the places that were known to be higher risk.

5. **Need for flood alert and response systems.**
The SSPEED Center, of which I am a member, has built real-time flood forecasts for Houston, and we (along with many other groups) have the capability to build a similar system for the Guadalupe River, given some time and resources.
As my colleague Phil Bedient has eloquently [argued](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/texas-flash-flood-prevent-gauge-warnings-20759811.php), we need to build a real-time flood forecasting system for the Guadalupe River.
A critical component of this is enhancing real-time data collection, namely stream and rainfall gauges, to monitor floods in real time.
However, these tools are only as useful as the trust that the community has in them, and the plans that the community has in place to respond to them.

I am not an expert on disaster response, communication, or the many agencies involved in flood response in this region, so I am in no position to point fingers or assign blame.
However, it is unacceptable that an advanced society can place so little value on human life that we allow events like this to occur. 
There must be **constructive accountability** to ensure that we avoid preventable tragedies like this in the future.

## Further reading

There has been a lot of excellent reporting on this horrific event.
Here are some sources that I've found especially useful:

### General Coverage

- [NY Times Coverage](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/07/07/us/texas-flooding-map-guadalupe-river.html) has generally been quite good
- Houston Chronicle: [*Camp Mystic and others hit by deadly floods were built partly in ‘extremely hazardous’ flood zones*](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/projects/2025/texas-camp-mystic-guadalupe-fema-floodplains/)
- Read (or, like me, listen to) Samantha Montano's book [*Disasterology*](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781488211720-disasterology)

### Meteorology and Weather Alerts

- Andrew Dessler does a good job of [explaining](https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/update-on-texas-flooding) the role of climate change in this event
- Marshall Shepherd [*Catastrophic flooding in Texas: Were there warnings?*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2025/07/05/catastrophic-flooding-in-texaswere-there-warnings/) provides a deep dive into the meteorological communication
- Daniel Swain's [Bluesky Thread](https://bsky.app/profile/weatherwest.bsky.social/post/3lta4d3vfk22z) also gets into the role of early warnings, communication, and dissemination

### Recommendations

- My colleague (and SSPEED Center director) Phil Bedient's opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle [*Flash-flooding deaths can be prevented, says storm expert. Here’s what Texas needs to do.*](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/texas-flash-flood-prevent-gauge-warnings-20759811.php)
- [*Hurricane Ian is proof: The US needs a national disaster safety board*](https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3702450-hurricane-ian-is-proof-the-us-needs-a-national-disaster-safety-board/)
- [FEMA](https://www.ready.gov/floods), the [Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/flood.html), and the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/safety/flood) all have excellent resources on flood preparedness and response that you should **print out and put on your fridge** if you live in an area prone to flooding.
