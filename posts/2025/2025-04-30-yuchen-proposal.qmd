Yuchen presented her research with confidence and expertise, demonstrating a deep understanding of nonstationary hydroclimate extremes and her innovative approaches to probabilistic analysis.
Her work promises to make significant contributions to our understanding of changing extreme weather patterns and their implications for infrastructure design and risk management.
Her first paper is already under review [@lu_spatiotemporal:2025], and future work is forthcoming.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to her committee members, Dr. Phil Bedient, Dr. Katherine Ensor, and Dr. Avantika Gori, for their thoughtful feedback and guidance throughout this process.
