Our preprint, led by [Yuchen Lu](../../people/grad-students/yuchen-lu.qmd) and titled "Bayesian Spatiotemporal Nonstationary Model Quantifies Robust Increases in Daily Extreme Rainfall Across the Western Gulf Coast", is now live on ArXiV [@lu_spatiotemporal:2025].

Extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, posing significant risks to communities and infrastructure. 
Traditional methods for estimating rainfall probabilities often assume that these patterns are stationary over time, which can lead to underestimations of future risks.
However, efforts to incorporate this nonstationarity have typically struggled with the challenge of robustly estimating trends in extremes given limited data.

To address this gap, we developed a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates nonstationarity and regionalization, providing more accurate estimates of extreme rainfall probabilities.
Our model, validated through rigorous testing, reveals increasing trends in extreme rainfall across the Western Gulf Coast, highlighting the need for updated risk assessments and infrastructure planning.
This approach can be applied to other hazards and regions to improve risk assessment and is especially relevant for site-scale flood-risk management applications like stormwater management.

Our paper is currently undergoing peer review, so results should be treated as preliminary.
