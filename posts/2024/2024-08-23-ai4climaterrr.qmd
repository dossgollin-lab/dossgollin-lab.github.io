We're delighted to announce the launch of a new project, *AI for Climate Risk and Resilience at Rice* (AI4ClimateRRR), which will bring together researchers from across the university to develop new tools for understanding and addressing climate risks.
AI4ClimateRRR is a cluster within the Ken Kennedy Institute.
Monthly meetings are available to the Rice community.
