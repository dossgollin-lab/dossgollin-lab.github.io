<p>20th century flood risk management emphasized the control of rivers and the prevention of flooding through a centralized, top-down paradigm.
Despite some successes, flood losses continue to increase, due mainly to increased construction in flood-prone areas and changing local and global environmental conditions.
This has led to an emerging consensus that large structural projects for flood risk management ought to be evaluated against and integrated into a portfolio of engineering, policy, and financial instruments such as wetland restoration, leaving “room for the river”, local vulnerability reduction measures, zoning changes, and insurance.
To address these challenges, we use tools from optimization, probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and stochastic hydrology to explore how combinations of “hard” and “soft” instruments might efficiently, ethically, and reliably reduce the disruption and damage of floods.</p>
