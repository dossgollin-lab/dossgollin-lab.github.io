<p>Fast-growing coastal megacities around the world, including Houston, rely on aging and often inadequate infrastructure to manage  evolving weather and climate risks such as flooding.
Yet although climate-driven changes in extreme precipitation are already evident in Texas and beyond, current NOAA Atlas 14 frequency analysis methods assume stationarity in both the historical data used in making the estimates and in the future conditions.
Thus, infrastructure built today is likely to be underprepared for future climate.
In this research, we are combining leverage Earth system observations at multiple timescales (recent radar observations, station observations, and paleoclimate reconstructions) with novel space-time statistical approaches to model the probability distributions of extreme rainfall.
This work can inform how existing or alternative engineering codes will perform under actual and anticipated climates.</p>
